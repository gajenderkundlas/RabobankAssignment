Back Office Systems - Mini Project
For: Senior Software Engineer / Full Stack Developer

Overview
This mini project is designed to gauge your existing knowledge and skillset and demonstrate
how you approach problems as a Senior Software Engineer/Full Stack Developer. The tasks in
this project reflect a simplified version of the type of work you can expect in this role. You
should consider doing things like documenting your code with XML comments, unit testing,
and following industry standard naming conventions as you&#39;ll want to demonstrate your
understanding of best practices. Your solution shall utilize NuGet and contain README.md
markdown file to document how to compile and run your application, as well as any other
important details.
You will have three days to complete this project. Once completed, please zip your project and
email it to your friendly Zappos Technical Recruiter.
Good luck and happy coding!
Part One – ETL Demonstration
Description
Create a method that would load Tab Separate Value (TSV) files into MySQL database tables.
The database and corresponding tables shall be created on the go if not exist. Sample TSV files
are provided with this write up. The first row contains the column names and each additional
row contains values to be inserted into the corresponding database table.
Your solution must be configurable so it can be used to target any local or remote MySQL
database, given the correct credentials.
Gotchas
Column order of data dump files can be random. Your program should be able to process for
any permutation of columns.

Part Two – Backend Demonstration
Description
Program backend web service endpoints that allow CRUD operations on individual records of
that table. Lastly, create an endpoint that provides the sum of inventory for all brands in the
database. Endpoints should be able to provide the response in both XML and JSON formats.
Your backend must be C# based. Be sure to follow standard rest conventions (http verbs and
naming convention). Please utilize Swagger UI.
